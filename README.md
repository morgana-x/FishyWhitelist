# FishyWhitelist
A plugin for [Fishy](https://github.com/ncrypted-dev/Fishy), a Community-Made Dedicated Server program for the game [Webfishing](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3146520/WEBFISHING/)

Allows you to whitelist SteamIds that join your server

Generates `whitelistConfig.toml` and `whitelist.txt`

whitelistConfig.toml is where you configure whether the plugin is enabled, and kick message etc

whitelist.txt is where all the whitelisted steamId64s are, seperated by new lines

Example:
```
76561197960287930
76561197960287930
```
(These steamids are just duplicates of gabe newell's steam account's as example)
